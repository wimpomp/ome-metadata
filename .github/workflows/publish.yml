      # allow-branch HEAD is because GitHub actions switches
      # to the tag while building, which is a detached head

      # Publishing is currently messy, because:
      #
      # * `peace_rt_model_core` exports `NativeError` or `WebError` depending on the target.
      # * `peace_rt_model_web` fails to build when publishing the workspace for a native target.
      # * `peace_rt_model_web` still needs its dependencies to be published before it can be
      #    published.
      # * `peace_rt_model_hack` needs `peace_rt_model_web` to be published before it can be
      #    published.
      #
      # We *could* pass through `--no-verify` so `cargo` doesn't build the crate before publishing,
      # which is reasonable, since this job only runs after the Linux, Windows, and WASM builds
      # have passed.
